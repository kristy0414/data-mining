# data mining method
Used classification tree, random forest, boosting etc.

Use classification tree to see the decision rule.
Use randome forest or boosting to lower the ensemble variance and to get a better prediction, it is used in the case that has low bais but high variance.

Prune the decision tree: use 1+SE rule to avoid overfit.
Data mining could be used in both classification and regression.

Data mining has two branches: supervised and unpervised. One has a label for obersevation, the other don't. One is to do prediction, the other is to find association among oberservations.

There are several projects that has been analyzed by data mining method through various topics to show you how it works.
